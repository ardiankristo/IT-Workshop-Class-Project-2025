## ðŸŽ¨ Personalization Guide (TODO List)

### Beginner Level Customization

  * **1. Website Title:** Change the `<title>` in the `<head>` (e.g., `[Your Name]'s Awesome Portfolio`).
  * **2. Main Heading:** Update the `<h1>` in the Hero Section (e.g., `[Your Name]'s Portfolio`).
  * **3. Tagline:** Personalize the `<p>` tagline below the main heading.

### Bonus Intermediate Level (Challenge Yourself\!)

  * **1. Add a Button to Scroll to a Specific Section:**
      * In the `<header>` section, below "Explore My Work" button, add another `<a>` tag.
      * **Example Code:**
        ```html
        <a
            onclick="scrollToSection('contact')"
            class="bg-gray-600 hover:bg-gray-500 text-white font-bold py-3 px-8 rounded-full shadow-lg transform hover:scale-105 transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer mt-4"
        >
            Contact Me <i class="fas fa-paper-plane ml-2"></i>
        </a>
        ```
      * Adjust `'contact'` to `'skills'` or `'achievements'` to scroll to other sections.
  * **2. Make a Favicon (Website Icon):**
      * Create a small image (`favicon.ico` or `favicon.png`) using an online favicon generator or your own design.
      * Add this line in the `<head>` section (around line 7):
        ```html
        <link rel="icon" href="path/to/your/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
        ```
      * Update `href` to your favicon file's relative path.
  * **3. Deploy Your Website (Make it Publicly Accessible\!):**
      * Search for "free website hosting service" (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
      * Generally involves creating an account, uploading your `index.html` and images, and following their deployment steps.

Have fun making your portfolio shine\! This is a fantastic step into the world of web development.
